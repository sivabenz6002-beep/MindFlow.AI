## 🧩 The Problem

Most learners study passively — reading notes, re-watching videos, hoping it sticks.  
They have no idea which topics they actually struggle with — until the real exam.

**The result?** Time wasted reviewing things they already know, while real weaknesses go undetected.

## 💡 The Solution

**SkillMap.ai** is an AI-powered learning system that:

1. **Quizzes you adaptively** — difficulty changes in real time based on how well you're doing
2. **Detects your weak spots** — tracks which topics you consistently get wrong
3. **Generates targeted learning content** — AI writes personalized explanations just for you
4. **Tracks your progress** — a live dashboard shows your performance over time
5. **Lets you chat with PDFs** — upload any study material and ask questions about it

Think of it as a smart tutor that knows exactly where you're struggling — and fixes it.

## ⚙️ How It Works — Step by Step

```
1. Login          → Authenticate into your personal learning session
         ↓
2. Pick a Domain  → Choose: Networking, AI & ML, Cloud Computing, Business Analyst
         ↓
3. Confirm Domain → Click "Confirm Selection" — this gates access to the quiz
         ↓
4. Take the Quiz  → Answer 15 adaptive MCQs, generated 2 at a time by AI
                    Questions are buffered: AI fetches the next batch in the
                    background so the quiz never pauses
         ↓
5. Submit Answer  → Each answer graded instantly, explanation shown,
                    score and accuracy cards update live
         ↓
6. View Results   → Score, overall accuracy, and per-difficulty breakdown
                    (Easy / Medium / Hard) shown on the results page
         ↓
7. AI Generates   → Personalized learning content for your weak areas
   Learning
         ↓
8. Dashboard      → Visual analytics, history, downloadable report
```

### 🔄 Adaptive Difficulty Engine

Every quiz **starts at Easy** and adjusts automatically based purely on your answer streaks:

| Condition | Action |
|---|---|
| ✅ 2 correct answers in a row | Increase difficulty: Easy → Medium → Hard |
| ❌ 2 wrong answers in a row | Decrease difficulty: Hard → Medium → Easy |
| No streak triggered | Keep current difficulty |

**Boundaries are enforced** — difficulty cannot go above Hard or below Easy.

When a streak threshold is hit, **both streaks are reset to 0** so the next transition requires a fresh 2-answer run. Each question's difficulty is color-coded on the card: 🟢 Easy, 🟡 Medium, 🔴 Hard.

All performance is tracked per-difficulty level (`diff_scores`) and shown as a breakdown on the Results page.

## ✨ Features

### 🧠 Adaptive Quiz Engine
15-question quizzes that **start at Easy** difficulty and adjust automatically using streak-based logic. The AI generates questions **2 at a time** via the FastAPI backend, buffering the next pair in the background so there's no wait between questions. Each question shows: question text, 4 labeled options (A/B/C/D), the correct answer, and a styled explanation box on submission.

### 📊 Live Stats Bar
Below each question a row of **3 glass-card chips** shows your running Score, Progress (e.g. `3/15`), and Accuracy % — all updating in real time without leaving the quiz.

### 📈 Per-Difficulty Breakdown
For every question answered, the system records **correct and total counts per difficulty level** (`Easy / Medium / Hard`). The Results page displays this as a color-coded 3-card grid so you can instantly see where you struggled.

### 🔍 Weak Topic Detection
After each quiz, the system automatically identifies which topics had the lowest accuracy and flags them for targeted learning.

### 📖 AI-Generated Learning Content
For each weak topic, the AI writes a personalized explanation, key points, and real-world example — tailored to your performance level (Beginner / Intermediate / Expert).

### 📄 PDF Chat (RAG)
Upload any PDF (textbook, notes, docs). The system embeds it into ChromaDB and lets you ask natural language questions about its content. Answers are pulled directly from the document.

### 📊 Performance Dashboard
A visual analytics page showing your quiz history, score trends, accuracy by difficulty, topic breakdowns, and a downloadable Markdown performance report.

### 🤖 Eduna — Floating AI Assistant
A context-aware chatbot always accessible on every page. Ask it anything — concept explanations, study tips, quiz guidance.

### 🔐 User Authentication
Secure login/register system with per-user session isolation. Your progress is always saved to your own account.

- A free [Groq API key](https://console.groq.com) (used as fallback)

---

### Step 1 — Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/skillmap-ai.git
cd skillmap-ai
```

### Step 2 — Create a Virtual Environment

```bash
# Create
python -m venv venv

# Activate (Windows)
venv\Scripts\activate

# Activate (macOS / Linux)
source venv/bin/activate
```

### Step 3 — Install All Dependencies

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Step 4 — Set Up Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file in the project root:

```env
GROQ_API_KEY=your_groq_api_key_here
```

### Step 5 — Pull the AI Model

```bash
ollama pull llama3
```

> If Ollama is not running, start it with: `ollama serve`

### Step 6 — Start the Backend

Open **Terminal 1**:

```bash
uvicorn api.main:app --reload --port 8000
```

You should see:  
`✅ Uvicorn running on http://127.0.0.1:8000`

### Step 7 — Start the Frontend

Open **Terminal 2** (virtual environment active):

```bash
streamlit run app.py
```

Your browser will open automatically at `http://localhost:8501` 🎉
